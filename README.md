# Internet-of-Heating

This project was born after our wireless thermostate mysteriously caught fire. I decided to put a WIFI enabled Electric IMP 
development board to use. The board drove a relay which closed or opened the boiler's heating circuit. A Web interface allowed 
us to turn the heating on and off with smart phone. Additionally, when the ehatong was on, the code on the board regularly 
turned the heating on and off for a certain period of time. 
While it more-or-less worked, I had some chalenges. For instance, the board was powered by batteries that depleted every day, 
thanks to the power-hungry relay.
